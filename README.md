# Covid-19-prediction

An end-to-end project which tries to predict the curve of the COVID-19 infections.

## Still under construction

The data is coming from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasets/covid-19/master/data/time-series-19-covid-combined.csv

This repo tries to predict the amount of infected people by country and state (if possible). 

For this project the following steps are being done:

 -Download data and transform it - done<br>
 -Analyze the data (Exporatory Data Analysis - EDA) - done<br>
 -First predictions using train and test - done<br>
 -Predictions of 7 days into the future - in progress<br>
 -Implement update routine - donebr>
 -Push output to a Tableau public dashboard - in progress<br>
