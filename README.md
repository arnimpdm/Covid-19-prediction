# Covid-19-prediction

An end-to-end project which tries to predict the curve of the COVID-19 infections.

The data is coming from: https://github.com/datasets/covid-19/blob/master/data/time-series-19-covid-combined.csv

 -Download data and transform it - done<br>
 -Analyze the data (Exporatory Data Analysis - EDA) - done<br>
 -First predictions using train and test - done<br>
 -Implement update routine - done<br>
 -Push output to a Tableau public dashboard - done<br>
